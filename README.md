# Bureau Of Skincare 🧴

There is an inherent need in all human beings to be accepted and loved for who they truly are.  The design elements of our interface are intimately crafted to exude a warm and inviting ambience for individuals desiring a personalized experience in managing their facial skincare routines through simple, yet empowering online tools.

## Description ✍🏽 
Our application tracks users’ daily facial skincare routines and provide simple charts that illustrate the connections between environmental factors, product usage and skin health.  What makes our platform unique is that it serves to encourage users to embrace their appearance and identity, advocating against the cultural obsession with flawlessness and unattainable perfection.


## Software Development Achievements and Future Goals 🏆

We set out to create a data-driven application that synthesizes the information the user provides at registration and the routines tab with key weather metrics (temperature, humidity and air quality) to come up with personalized skincare advice.  In addition to the weather data retrieved from AirVisual API, we provided product data from Sephora API as well.  The MyRoutines tab allows the user to create morning and evening routines and indicate daily usage, which will then be displayed in a bar chart on the MyPage tab.  At the bottom of the MyRoutines tab, the user can also indicate their mood with simple emoticons that will subsequently be displayed along the horizontal axis of the bar chart.
At different times of the day, MyPage will display different skincare and wellness suggestions beside the weather data.  As a future enhancement, we can imagine working with AI capabilities such as machine learning to understand the user better.  We would also like to subscribe to a data provider that is not represented by an individual brand, like Sephora, but covers a much larger range of products globally.
