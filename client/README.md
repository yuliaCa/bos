Bureau Of Skincare

There is an inherent need in all human beings to be accepted and loved for who they truly are.  The design elements of our interface are intimately crafted to exude a warm and inviting ambience for individuals desiring a personalized experience in managing their facial skincare routines through simple, yet empowering online tools.

Description: Our application tracks users’ daily facial skincare routines and provide simple charts that illustrate the connections between environmental factors, product usage and skin health.  What makes our platform unique is that it serves to encourage users to embrace their natural appearance and self-identity, advocating against the cultural obsession with flawlessness and unattainable perfection.

Software Development Achievements and Future Goals

We set out to create a data-driven application that synthesizes the information the user provides at registration and the routines tab with key weather metrics (temperature, humidity and air quality) to come up with personalized skincare advice.  In addition to the weather data retrieved from AirVisual API, we provided product data from Sephora API as well.  The MyRoutines tab allows the user to create morning and evening routines and indicate daily usage, which will then be displayed in a bar chart on the MyPage tab.  At the bottom of the MyRoutines tab, the user can also indicate their mood with simple emoticons that will subsequently be displayed along the horizontal axis of the bar chart.
At different times of the day, MyPage will display different skincare and wellness suggestions beside the weather data.  As a future enhancement, we can imagine working with AI capabilities such as machine learning to understand the user better.  We would also like to subscribe to a data provider that is not represented by an individual brand, like Sephora, but covers a much larger range of products globally.


# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
